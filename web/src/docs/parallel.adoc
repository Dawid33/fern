= Parallel Compilation
:bibtex-file: references.bib
	

Research into this niche has been historically of low priority. Traditional
compiler architecture in the 70’s was focused on minimising memory use and
optimising for single threaded performance. This was at a time when computers
didn’t even have enough ram to store all the data necessary for compiling large
amounts of source code. Times have since changed. The memory available in a
computer is much more abundant than before and experts predict that single
threaded processor speed will soon plateau.
